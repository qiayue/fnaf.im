                        <p>FNAF 2 is the thrilling sequel to the original Five Nights at Freddy’s, developed by Scott Cawthon and released by ScottGames in 2014. Set in the eerie Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, players step into the shoes of Jeremy Fitzgerald, a new security guard tasked with monitoring the animatronic characters. Unlike the first game, FNAF 2 introduces a host of new characters and enhanced gameplay mechanics that elevate the horror experience. With limited power and a complex camera system, surviving each night from midnight to 6 a.m. requires strategy and quick reflexes. Whether you're a longtime fan or new to the series, FNAF 2 offers an immersive and spine-chilling adventure that keeps you on the edge of your seat.</p>
